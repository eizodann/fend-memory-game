# Memory Game Project

A [Udacity](www.udacity.com) project developed using HTMl, CSS, JavaScript.

## How To Play:

This is a memory matching card game. The goal is to match each card's icon with its pair. There are 16 cards and 8 pairs total. Click on a card, remember its icon and spot in the grid, then continue clicking other cards until you find its match. The game ends once all pairs are matched.

Keep track of progress in the score panel area by viewing the star rating, how many moves have been made, and how long it takes to finish the game.
